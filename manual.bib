  abstract = {In peatlands, carbon storage is mainly controlled by the degree of peat water saturation which is highly affected by the development of drainage networks. Changes and self-organization of drains with time were observed in many peatlands, suggesting a self-modification of the water storage. This raises questions about the origin of these changes in drainage pattern, and about the impact of these changes on the water balance and on peat saturation. In the present study, historical photographs of the "La Guette" peatland (France) were used to reconstruct the drainage pattern and the land cover change from 1945 to 2010. A morphological index, quantifying the transition from parallel to dendritic network, was found to decrease with the increase in tree cover, demonstrating a strict relationship between land cover and drainage pattern changes. A sensitivity analysis of the effect of drainage patterns on the water balance conducted with a ground water model and calibrated with a modern dataset suggested that since 1945 the development of the drainage pattern increased the drainage capacity of the system by 1.5 fold. These observations evidenced a positive feedback in which tree invasion changed the drainage pattern, increasing the peatland drainage capacity and reducing the water storage capacity.},
