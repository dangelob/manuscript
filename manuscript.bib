  abstract = {CO2 and CH4 fluxes during the winter were measured at natural and drained bog and fen sites in eastern Finland using both the closed chamber method and calculations of gas diffusion along a concentration gradient through the snowpack. The snow diffusion results were compared with those obtained by chamber, but the winter flux estimates were derived from chamber data only. CH4 emissions from a poor bog were lower than those from an oligotrophic fen, while both CO2 and CH4 fluxes were higher in theCarex rostrata- occupied marginal (lagg) area of the fen than in the slightly less fertile centre. Average estimated winter CO2-C losses from virgin and drained forested peatlands were 41 and 68 g CO2-C m-2, respectively, accounting for 23 and 21\% of the annual total CO2 release from the peat. The mean release of CH4-C was 1.0 g in natural bogs and 3.4 g m-2 in fens, giving rise to winter emissions averaging to 22\% of the annual emission from the bogs and 10\% of that from the fens. These wintertime carbon gas losses in Finnish natural peatlands were even greater than reported average long-term annual C accumulation values (less than 25g C m-2). The narrow range of 10{\textendash}30\% of the proportion of winter CO2 and CH4 emissions from annual emissions found in Finnish peatlands suggest that a wider generalization in the boreal zone is possible. Drained forested bogs emitted 0.3 g CH4-C m-2 on the average, while the effectively drained fens consumed an average of 0.01 g CH4-C m-2. Reason for the low CH4. efflux or net oxidation in drained peatlands probably lies in low substrate supply and thus low CH4 production in the anoxic deep peat layers. N2O release from a fertilized grassland site in November{\textendash}May was 0.7 g N2O m-2, accounting for 38\% of the total annual emission, while a forested bog released none and two efficiently drained forested fens 0.09 (28\% of annual release) and 0.04 g N2O m-2 (27\%) during the winter, respectively.},

  abstract = {Boreal and subarctic peatlands comprise a carbon pool of 455 Pg that has accumulated during the postglacial period at an average net rate of 0.096 Pg/yr (1 Pg = 1015g). Using Clymo's (1984) model, the current rate is estimated at 0.076 Pg/yr. Longterm drainage of these peatlands is estimated to be causing the oxidation to CO2 of a little more than 0.0085 Pg/yr, with conbustion of fuel peat adding {\textdegree}0.026 Pg/yr. Emissions of CH4 are estimated to release {\textdegree} 0.046 Pg of carbon annually. Uncertainties beset estimates of both stocks and fluxes, particularly with regard to Soviet peatlands. The influence of water table alterations upon fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 is in great need of investigation over a wide range of peatland environments, especially in regions where permafrost melting, thermokarst erosion, and the development of thaw lakes are likely results of climatic warming. The role of fire in the carbon cycle of peatlands also deserves increased attention. Finally, satellite{\textemdash}monitoring of the abundance of open water in the peatlands of the West Siberian Plain and the Hudson/James Bay Lowland is suggested as a likely method of detecting early effects of climatic warming upon boreal and subarctic peatlands.},

This article focuses on the contribution of natural ecosystems (forests, grasslands) and agrosystems to carbon sequestration either in biomass or in soil. Carbon stocks are important (650 Gt in biomass, 1500 to 2000 Gt in soils as compared with 750 for atmospheric CO2), and also fluxes that led to CO2 emissions in the past (due to deforestation or cultivation) and which now turn to carbon sequestration (2 GtC/year). This article shows great spatial variations in stocks and fluxes and great measurement difficulties, especially for stock variations. Anthropic actions such as reforestation (mainly in the North), changes in land use or in crop management, can increase carbon sequestration in biomass or soil, with a residence time of several decades, which is not insignificant with respect to the Kyoto protocol and which also has other environmental benefits.

  abstract = {Measurements on air trapped in old polar ice have revealed that the pre-industrial atmosphere contained 280 ppm of CO2 and that \ensuremath{\delta}13C of atmospheric CO2 decreased by about 1.1 \%, until 1980. These measurements show that considerable amounts of non-fossil CO2 must have already been emitted into the atmosphere in the 19th century. Quantitative estimates of the emission rates were performed by deconvolving the CO2 and \ensuremath{\delta}13C records, using models of the global carbon cycle (box-diffusion and outcrop-diffusion ocean, four-box biosphere). Depending on the structure of the ocean submodel, deconvolution of the CO2 record yields a cumulative non-fossil production of about 90 to 150 Gt C until 1980, of which more than 50\% were released prior to 1900. According to the model results, the net non-fossil production rate was roughly constant in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century. In the past 30 years, smaller values are obtained (0-0.9 Gt C yr-1) which are at the lower limit or below current ecological estimates for deforestation and land use (1.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.8 Gt C yr-1). The difference might possibly be due to other sinks, e.g., stimulation of plant productivity by the enhanced CO2 concentration. Calculated 13C and 14C time histories agree well with the observed changes. While the change of the atmospheric CO2 concentration reflects more the cumulative carbon release, the isotope concentrations are more sensitive to short-term changes of the emission rate. The reason is that the oceanic uptake capacity is smaller for excess CO2 by the buffer factor of {\texttildelow} 10 than for an isotopic perturbation.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration, RS, the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO2) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux. However, the dynamics of RS are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained. Ecosystem warming experiments, modelling analyses and fundamental biokinetics all suggest that RS should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of RS, inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure RS on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global RS values in the extant four-decade record of RS chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide RS observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the RS record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO2 measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961{\textendash}1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in RS. We estimate that the global RS in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 \ensuremath{\pm} 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr-1 between 1989 and 2008, implying a global RS response to air temperature (Q10) of 1.5. An increasing global RS value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

  abstract = {Purpose CH4 emissions from peatlands are space and time dependent. The variety of efflux routes contributes to these variabilities. CH4 bubbling remains difficult to investigate since it occurs on a timescale of seconds. The aims of this study were to use for the first time the recently built infrared high-resolution spectrometer, SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Troposph{\'e}rique to (1) measure in situ CH 4 fluxes in natural and artificial peatland plot and (2) observe online bubbling events with quantification of CH 4 emission fluxes corresponding to this very sudden degassing event. Material and methods The closed dynamic chamber method was used and the gas concentration was measured every 1.5 s. Emission fluxes were calculated by the accumulation rate of CH 4 against time. Measurements were undertaken during daytime in March 2009 and during day- and nighttime in May 2009, in Sphagnum and Betula plots and in a wet artificially bared peat area with Eriophorum vaginatum . Results and discussion The results show that the CH 4 emissions estimated with the SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Troposph{\'e}rique (SPIRIT) are consistent with those already published. The high emissions, both through diffusion and bubbling in the Eriophorum plot, were on the same order as the emissions estimated in natural shallow pools. During daytime, CH 4 bubbling was higher in May (54.7\% of the total emission) than in March (40.7\%) probably because of increased CH 4 production and accumulation in peat. In May, bubbling was higher at nighttime (65.5\%) than in daytime (54.7\%). This has an important implication for carbon budget assessment in peatlands. Conclusions The recently built infrared spectrometer, SPIRIT, was able to reliably measure CH 4 fluxes and quantify CH 4 flux during the degassing of bubbles. The emissions obtained are in agreement with previously published data using other measurement techniques. The results of this preliminary work highlight (1) the importance of shallow pools in peatland CH 4 emissions and (2) the sensitivity of such fluxes to atmospheric pressure, a relation that has not been fully investigated or taken into account in assessing peatland carbon balance.},

Chambers were tested on fine and coarse homogeneous quartz sand with particle sizes of 0.05{\textendash}0.2 and 0.6 mm, respectively. The effect of soil moisture on chamber measurements was tested by wetting the fine quartz sand to about 25\% volumetric water content. Non-steady-state through-flow chambers either underestimated or overestimated fluxes from -21 to +33\% depending on the type of chamber and the method of mixing air within the chamber's headspace. However, when results of all systems tested were averaged, fluxes were within 4\% of references. Non-steady-state non-through-flow chambers underestimated or overestimated fluxes from {\textendash}35 to +6\%. On average, the underestimation was about 13{\textendash}14\% on fine sand and 4\% on coarse sand. When the length of the measurement period was increased, the underestimation increased due to the rising concentration within the chamber headspace, which reduced the diffusion gradient within the soil. Steady-state through-flow chambers worked almost equally well in all sand types used in this study. They overestimated the fluxes on average by 2{\textendash}4\%. Overall, the reliability of the chambers was not related to the measurement principle per se. Even the same chambers, with different collar designs, showed highly variable results. The mixing of air within the chamber can be a major source of error. Excessive turbulence inside the chamber can cause mass flow of CO2 from the soil into the chamber. The chamber headspace concentration also affects the flux by altering the concentration gradient between the soil and the chamber.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter introduces a variety of methods for measurement of soil respiration. Accurate measurements of soil \{CO2\} efflux are extraordinarily challenging due to the properties of \{CO2\} transport in a porous medium of soil. Any measurement methods that disturb the soil \{CO2\} concentration and/or distort the gradient would result in serious errors. The most commonly used are chamber methods, which include the closed dynamic-chamber method, the open dynamic-chamber method, and the closed static-chamber method. Soil respiration is determined using alkali traps, by absorbing \{CO2\} released from the soil into a sealed headspace chamber for a specific period, using NaOH or \{KOH\} solutions. The soda-lime technique has been used for more than 40 years to measure \{CO2\} effluxes from soil under field conditions. Soil respiration can also be estimated from air samples from different depths of soil using the gas-well method. This chapter describes the basic principles behind those methods, discusses chamber designs and deployment, and assesses the accuracy and potential issues of those methods. It also briefly describes a few indirect methods for estimation of soil respiration.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) exchange was studied at flark (minerotrophic hollow), lawn and hummock microsites in an oligotrophic boreal pine fen. Statistical response functions were constructed for the microsites in order to reconstruct the annual CO 2 exchange balance from climate data. Carbon accumulation was estimated from the annual net CO 2 exchange, methane (CH 4 ) emissions and leaching of carbon. Due to high water tables in the year 1993, the average carbon accumulation at the flark, Eriophorum lawn, Carex lawn and hummock microsites was high, 2.91, 6.08, 2.83 and 2.66 mol C m {\textendash}2 , respectively, and for the whole peatland it was 5.66 mol m {\textendash}2 year {\textendash}1 . During the maximum primary production period in midsummer, hummocks with low water tables emitted less methane than predicted from the average net ecosystem exchange (NEE), while the Carex lawns emitted slightly more. CH 4 release during that period corresponded to 16\% of the contemporary NEE. Annual C accumulation rate did not correlate with annual CH 4 release in the microsites studied, but the total community CO 2 release seemed to be related to CH 4 emissions in the wet microsites, again excluding the hummocks. The dependence of CO 2 exchange dynamics on weather events suggests that daily balances in C accumulation are labile and can change from net carbon uptake to net release, primarily in high hummocks on fens under warmer, drier climatic conditions.},

  volume = {12},
  doi = {10.1029/98GB02426},
  abstract = {We measured seasonal patterns of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in a diverse peatland complex underlain by discontinuous permafrost in northern Manitoba, Canada, as part of the Boreal Ecosystems Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Study sites spanned the full range of peatland trophic and moisture gradients found in boreal environments from bog (pH 3.9) to rich fen (pH 7.2). During midseason (July-August, 1996), highest rates of NEE and respiration followed the trophic sequence of bog (5.4 to -3.9 \ensuremath{\mu}mol CO2 m-2 s-1) \ensuremath{<} poor fen (6.3 to -6.5 \ensuremath{\mu}mol CO2 m-2 s-1) \ensuremath{<} intermediate fen (10.5 to -7.8 \ensuremath{\mu}mol CO2 m-2 s-1) \ensuremath{<} rich fen (14.9 to -8.7 \ensuremath{\mu}mol CO2m-2 s-1). The sequence changed during spring (May-June) and fall (September-October) when ericaceous shrub (e.g., Chamaedaphne calyculata) bogs and sedge (Carex spp.) communities in poor to intermediate fens had higher maximum CO2 fixation rates than deciduous shrub-dominated (Salix spp. and Betula spp.) rich fens. Timing of snowmelt and differential rates of peat surface thaw in microtopographic hummocks and hollows controlled the onset of carbon uptake in spring. Maximum photosynthesis and respiration were closely correlated throughout the growing season with a ratio of approximately 1/3 ecosystem respiration to maximum carbon uptake at all sites across the trophic gradient. Soil temperatures above the water table and timing of surface thaw and freeze-up in the spring and fall were more important to net CO2 exchange than deep soil warming. This close coupling of maximum CO2 uptake and respiration to easily measurable variables, such as trophic status, peat temperature, and water table, will improve models of wetland carbon exchange. Although trophic status, aboveground net primary productivity, and surface temperatures were more important than water level in predicting respiration on a daily basis, the mean position of the water table was a good predictor (r2 = 0.63) of mean respiration rates across the range of plant community and moisture gradients. Q10 values ranged from 3.0 to 4.1 from bog to rich fen, but when normalized by above ground vascular plant biomass, the Q10 for all sites was 3.3.},

  abstract = {Methane emissions were measured by a static chamber technique in a diverse peatland complex in the Northern Study Area (NSA) of the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Sampling areas represented a wide range of plant community and hydrochemical gradients (pH 3.9{\textendash}7.0). Emissions were generally larger than those reported from other boreal wetland environments at similar latitude. Seasonal average fluxes from treed peatlands (including palsas) ranged from 0 to 20 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 compared with 92 to 380 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 in open graminoid bogs and fens (with maximum single fluxes up to 1355 mg CH4 m-2 d-1). Permafrost-related collapse scars had similarly high CH4 emissions, particularly in the lag areas where continuous measurements of water table, peat surface elevation, and peat temperature showed that the peat surface adjusted to a falling water table in the abnormally dry 1994 season, maintaining warm, saturated conditions and high CH4 flux later into the season than nonfloating sites. A predictive model for CH4 flux and environmental variables was developed using multiple stepwise regression. A combined variable of mean seasonal peat temperature at the average position of the water table explained most of the spatial variability in log CH4 flux (r2 = 0.64), with height above mean water table (HMWT), water chemistry (Kcorr, pH, Ca), tree cover, and herbaceous plant cover explaining additional variance (r2 = 0.81). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of combined vascular and bryophyte data with environmental variables showed that CH4 flux was negatively correlated with HMWT, the second axis of vegetation variability, and was only weakly correlated with chemistry, the first axis. Sedge and tree cover were correlated with high and low CH4 fluxes, respectively, while shrub cover was of less predictive value. Microtopographic groupings of hummocks and hollows were separated in terms of CH4 flux at the intermediate ranges of the moisture gradient. These data show that multivariate vegetation analyses may provide a useful framework for integrating the complex environmental controls on CH4 flux and extrapolating single point chamber measurements to the landscape scale using remote sensing.

The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) the magnitude of diurnal and seasonal variation in CH4 net flux, (ii) the relationship between the temporally varying flux rates and associated changes in controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and (iii) the contribution of CH4 emission to the ecosystem growing season carbon budget. There was significant diurnal variation in CH4 emission during the peak of the growing season that was strongly correlated with associated changes in solar radiation, latent heat flux, air temperature and ecosystem conductance to water vapor. During days 181{\textendash}215, nighttime average CH4 efflux was only 47\% of the average midday values. The peak value for daily average CH4 emission rate was approximately 80 nmol m-2 s-1 (4.6 mg CH4 m-2 h-1), and seasonal variation in CH4 flux was strongly correlated with changes in soil temperature. Integrated over the entire measurement period {[}days 144{\textendash}269 (late May{\textendash}late September)], the total CH4 emission was 3.2 g CH4 m-2, which was quite low relative to other wetland ecosystems and to the simultaneous high rate of ecosystem net CO2 sequestration that was measured (18.1 mol CO2 m-2 or 217 g C m-2). We estimate that the negative radiative forcing (cooling) associated with net carbon storage over the life of the peatland (approximately 2200 years) was at least twice the value of positive radiative forcing (warming) caused by net CH4 emission over the last 50 years.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the spatial variability of methane (CH4) emissions, net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE), and dissolved carbon (CH4, CO2, and DOC) were made in a boreal patterned peatland in northern Sweden in the summers (May to September) of 1992 and 1993. Carbon balance terms were measured and the carbon balance inferred at different peatland surface topography features (e.g. ridges, lawns, and pools) and at different positions within the peatland (e.g. plateau, margin). Combining these data permits a comparison of the carbon balance at the peatland scale for the two field seasons.Trends in the spatial variability of the net carbon storage, as determined by the difference between inputs and outputs, suggest that carbon storage decreased in lawns from the margin of the peatland to the central plateau, while the reverse trend occurred in ridges. This indicates a difference in carbon exchange processes between sites with different surface topography due to differences in soil moisture and temperature.Total carbon storage for the peatland, weighted for topographic variability, indicates that the peatland gained carbon in 1992 (2.0 g C m-\ensuremath{\mkern1mu}2), but lost carbon in 1993 (\ensuremath{\mkern1mu}-\ensuremath{\mkern1mu} 7.6 g C m-\ensuremath{\mkern1mu}2). There was little variation in mean seasonal air temperature and total precipitation between the two years suggesting that the timing and magnitude of temperature and precipitation variation within the growing season are important for the season carbon balance. Because the carbon storage differences were small relative to the potential errors we conclude that the peatland was neither a net sink nor source of atmospheric carbon. This research demonstrates the importance of position in a peatland for the inference of long-term carbon accumulation and the assessment of contemporary exchange rates.},

The budget considers both fluvial and gaseous carbon fluxes and includes estimates of particulate organic carbon (POC); dissolved organic carbon (DOC); excess dissolved CO2; release of methane (CH4); net ecosystem respiration of CO2; and uptake of CO2 by primary productivity. All components except CH4 were measured directly in the catchment and annual carbon budgets were calculated for the catchment between 1993 and 2005 using both extrapolation and interpolation methods. The study shows that: Over the 13 year study period the total carbon balance varied between a net sink of - 20 to - 91 Mg C/km2/yr. The biggest component of this budget is the uptake of carbon by primary productivity (- 178 Mg C/km2/yr) and in most years the second largest component is the loss of DOC from the peat profile (+ 39 Mg C/km2/yr). Direct exchanges of C with the atmosphere average - 89 Mg C/km2/yr in the catchment. Extrapolating the general findings of the carbon budget across all UK peatlands results in an approximate carbon balance of - 1.2 Tg C/yr (\ensuremath{\pm} 0.4 Pg C/yr) which is larger than previously reported values. Carbon budgets should always be reported with a clear statement of the techniques used and errors involved as this is significant when comparing results across studies.},

We used a closed infrared gas exchange system to measure soil CO2 flux. The rates of CO2 evolution from hummocks (9.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 3.5 g m-2 d-1, {[}mean \ensuremath{\pm} SE]) were consistently higher than those from hollows (5.4 \ensuremath{\pm} 2.9 g m-2 d-1) (the hummock values included the contribution of moss dark respiration, which may account for 10{\textendash}20\% of the total measured flux). The soil CO2 flux was strongly temperature-dependent (Q10 \ensuremath{\approx} 3.7) and appeared to be linearly related to changes in water table depth. An empirical multiplicative model, using peat temperature and water table depth as independent variables, explained about 81\% of the variance in the CO2 flux data. Using the empirical model with measurements of peat temperature and estimates of hollow/hummock microtopographic distribution (relative to water table elevation), daily rates of {\textquotedblleft}site-averaged{\textquotedblright} CO2 evolution were calculated.

There was no significant statistical difference between the relationships of midday mean NEE with narrow- and broad-band NDVI and SR, measured during and calculated for that same time window, respectively. The skill of broad-band NDVI and SR in predicting CO2 fluxes was higher for metrics dominated by gross photosynthesis and lowest for ecosystem respiration, with NEE in between. A method based on a simple light response model whose parameters were parameterised based on broad-band NDVI allowed to improve predictions of daily NEE and is suggested to hold promise for filling gaps in the NEE time series. Relationships of CO2 flux metrics with broad-band NDVI and SR however generally differed between the two studied grassland sites indicting an influence of additional factors not yet accounted for.},

  doi = {10.1007/s11273-013-9320-8},
  abstract = {Northern peatland water table position is tightly coupled to carbon (C) cycling dynamics and is predicted to change from shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns associated with global climate change. However, it is uncertain how long-term water table alterations will alter C dynamics in northern peatlands because most studies have focused on short-term water table manipulations. The goal of our study was to quantify the effect of long-term water table changes ({\textasciitilde}80 years) on gaseous C fluxes in a peatland in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Chamber methods were utilized to measure ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and methane (CH4) fluxes in a peatland experiencing levee induced long-term water table drawdown and impoundment in relation to an unaltered site. Inundation raised water table levels by approximately {\textasciitilde}10 cm and resulted in a decrease in ER and GPP, but an increase of CH4 emissions. Conversely, the drained sites, with water table levels {\textasciitilde}15 cm lower, resulted in a significant increase in ER and GPP, but a decrease in CH4 emissions. However, NEE was not significantly different between the water table treatments. In summary, our data indicates that long-term water table drawdown and inundation was still altering peatland gaseous C fluxes, even after 80 years. In addition, many of the patterns we found were of similar magnitude to those measured in short-term studies, which indicates that short-term studies might be useful for predicting the direction and magnitude of future C changes in peatlands.},

Light saturation can be difficult to achieve and reduces the precision of fluorescence measurements. Consequently, we calculated the rate of electron transport at 1200 mumol photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) quanta m(-2) s(-1) from chlorophyll fluorescence measurements on intact soybean leaves {[}Glycine max (L.)

Electron transport rate was maximal around 37degreesC and the decline in rate following further increases in leaf temperature to 43degreesC was found to be completely reversible immediately upon return to lower temperatures. We report a convenient, new equation for the temperature dependence of the rate of electron transport under high irradiance: J(T(L)) = J(T(o))e(-(TL-To/Omega)2), where T(L) is the leaf temperature (degreesC), J (T(o)) is the rate of electron transport at the optimum temperature T(o), and Omega is the difference in temperature from T(o) at which J falls to e(-1) (0.37) of its value at T(o). Increased supply of nitrate increased J (T(o)). Acclimation to growth temperature was observed, with T(o) increasing from 35.4degreesC to 39.2degreesC for soybean plants grown at 20/15degreesC and 32/27degreesC (day/night), respectively. The average value of Omega was 18 +/- 0.6degreesC and was unaltered by growth conditions.

  abstract = {Undisturbed peatlands represent long-term net sinks of carbon; however, peat extraction converts these systems into large and persistent sources of greenhouse gases. Although rewetting and restoration following peat extraction have taken place over the last several decades, very few studies have investigated the longer term impact of this restoration on peatland carbon balance. We determined the annual carbon balance of a former horticulturally-extracted peatland restored 10 yr prior to the study and compared these values to the carbon balance measured at neighboring unrestored and natural sites. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured using the chamber technique biweekly during the growing season from May to October 2010 and three times over the winter period. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export was measured from remnant ditches in the unrestored and restored sites. During the growing season the restored site had greater uptake of CO2 than the natural site when photon flux density was greater than 1000 \ensuremath{\mu}mol m-2 s-1, while the unrestored site remained a source of CO2. Ecosystem respiration was similar between natural and restored sites, which were both significantly lower than the unrestored site. Methane flux remained low at the restored site except from open water pools, created as part of restoration, and remnant ditches. Export of DOC during the growing season was 5.0 and 28.8 g m-2 from the restored and unrestored sites, respectively. Due to dry conditions during the study year all sites acted as net carbon sources with annual balance of the natural, restored and unrestored sites of 250.7, 148.0 and 546.6 g C m-2, respectively. Although hydrological conditions and vegetation community at the restored site remained intermediate between natural and unrestored conditions, peatland restoration resulted in a large reduction in annual carbon loss from the system resulting in a carbon balance more similar to a natural peatland.},

  abstract = {During 2 years (2009, 2010), CO2 fluxes were measured in an oligotrophic fen located at the ecotonal limit of forest tundra and lichen woodland, in northeastern Canada. Peatlands in this region have registered a rise in surface moisture since Little Ice Age, allowing an increase in their pool size and density. In the studied peatland, 83 \% of the surface is covered either with pools (42 \%), hollows (28 \%) and lawns (13 \%) all of which present a mean water table higher than 7 cm. We evaluated how these conditions might influence the CO2 balance in these poor fens located in the northeastern section of the La Grande river watershed. During the two years measurements, results indicate a net CO2 source with 404 (\ensuremath{\pm}287) and 272 (\ensuremath{\pm}250) g CO2 m-2 year-1 emitted to the atmosphere throughout the growing seasons and winters. Modeled wintertime net ecosystem exchange resulted in a net loss of 150 (\ensuremath{\pm}36) and 150 (\ensuremath{\pm}37) g CO2 m-2 year-1 in 2009 and 2010 respectively, while 248 (\ensuremath{\pm}248) and 124 (\ensuremath{\pm}195) g CO2 m-2 was emitted during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons. This high CO2 source can be attributed to three factors: (1) the length of the cold season which represented 210{\textendash}214 days of net CO2 loss (2) a high pool/vegetated surface ratio since pools are a net source of CO2 and presented 38{\textendash}40 \% of the annual spatially weighted CO2 budget and (3) hydroclimatic conditions during the growing season as dryer and warmer conditions in 2009 reduced photosynthesis and increased respiration rates.},

  abstract = {This study uses a 12-year time series (2001{\textendash}2012) of eddy covariance measurements to investigate the long-term net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) and inter-annual variations in relation to abiotic drivers in a boreal fen in northern Sweden. The peatland was a sink for atmospheric CO2 in each of the twelve study years with a 12-year average (\ensuremath{\pm} standard deviation) NEE of -58 \ensuremath{\pm} 21 g C m-2 yr-1. For ten out of twelve years, the cumulative annual NEE was within a range of -42 to -79 g C m-2 yr-1 suggesting a general state of resilience of NEE to moderate inter-annual climate variations. However, the annual NEE of -18 and -106 g C m-2 yr-1 in 2006 and 2008, respectively, diverged considerably from this common range. The lower annual CO2 uptake in 2006 was mainly due to late summer emissions related to an exceptional drop in water table level (WTL). A positive relationship (R 2 = 0.65) between pre-growing season (January to April) air temperature (Ta) and summer (June to July) gross ecosystem production (GEP) was observed. We suggest that enhanced GEP due to mild pre-growing season air temperature in combination with air temperature constraints on ecosystem respiration (ER) during the following cooler summer explained most of the greater net CO2 uptake in 2008. Differences in the annual and growing season means of other abiotic variables (e.g. radiation, vapor pressure deficit, precipitation) and growing season properties (i.e. start date, end date, length) were unable to explain the inter-annual variations of NEE. Overall, our findings suggest that this boreal fen acts as a persistent contemporary sink for atmospheric CO2 that is, however, susceptible to severe anomalies in WTL and pre-growing season air temperature associated with predicted changes in climate patterns for the boreal region.},

  abstract = {Although northern peatlands cover only 3\% of the land surface, their thick peat deposits contain an estimated one-third of the world's soil organic carbon (SOC). Under a changing climate the potential of peatlands to continue sequestering carbon is unknown. This paper presents an analysis of 6 years of total carbon balance of an almost intact Atlantic blanket bog in Glencar, County Kerry, Ireland. The three components of the measured carbon balance were: the land-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported in a stream draining the peatland. The 6 years C balance was computed from 6 years (2003{\textendash}2008) of measurements of meteorological and eddy-covariance CO2 fluxes, periodic chamber measurements of CH4 fluxes over 3.5 years, and 2 years of continuous DOC flux measurements. Over the 6 years, the mean annual carbon was -29.7\ensuremath{\pm}30.6 (\ensuremath{\pm}1 SD) g C m-2 yr-1 with its components as follows: carbon in CO2 was a sink of -47.8\ensuremath{\pm}30.0 g C m-2 yr-1; carbon in CH4 was a source of 4.1\ensuremath{\pm}0.5 g C m-2 yr-1 and the carbon exported as stream DOC was a source of 14.0\ensuremath{\pm}1.6 g C m-2 yr-1. For 2 out of the 6 years, the site was a source of carbon with the sum of CH4 and DOC flux exceeding the carbon sequestered as CO2. The average C balance for the 6 years corresponds to an average annual growth rate of the peatland surface of 1.3 mm yr-1.},

  abstract = {Empirical greenhouse gas (GHG) flux estimates from diverse peatlands are required in order to derive emission factors for managed peatlands. This study on a drained fen peatland quantified the annual GHG balance (Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and C exported in crop yield) from spring barley (SB) and reed canary grass (RCG) using static opaque chambers for GHG flux measurements and biomass yield for indirectly estimating gross primary production (GPP). Estimates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and GPP were compared with more advanced but costly and labor-intensive dynamic chamber studies. Annual GHG balance for the two cropping systems was 4.0 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 and 8.1 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.2 Mg CO2-Ceq ha-1 from SB and RCG, respectively (mean \ensuremath{\pm} standard error, n = 3). Annual CH4 emissions were negligible (\ensuremath{<}0.006 Mg CO2-Ceq ha-1), and N2O emissions contributed only 4{\textendash}13 \% of the full GHG balance (0.5 and 0.3 Mg CO2-Ceq ha-1 for SB and RCG, respectively). The statistical significance of low CH4 and N2O fluxes was evaluated by a simulation procedure which showed that most of CH4 fluxes were within the range that could arise from random variation associated with actual zero-flux situations. ER measured by static chamber and dynamic chamber methods was similar, particularly when using nonlinear regression techniques for flux calculations. A comparison of GPP derived from aboveground biomass and from measuring net ecosystem exchange (NEE) showed that GPP estimation from biomass might be useful, or serve as validation, for more advanced flux measurement methods. In conclusion, combining static opaque chambers for measuring ER of CO2 and CH4 and N2O fluxes with biomass yield for GPP estimation worked well in the drained fen peatland cropped to SB and RCG and presented a valid alternative to estimating the full GHG balance by dynamic chambers.},

Blanket bogs, i.e. nutrient-poor peatlands restricted to maritime climates, may be extra vulnerable to global warming since they require a positive water balance to sustain their moss dominated vegetation and C sink functioning. This study presents a 4.5 year record of land{\textendash}atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange from the And{\o}ya blanket bog in northern Norway. Compared with other peatlands, the And{\o}ya peatland exhibited low flux rates, related to the low productivity of the dominating moss and lichen communities and the maritime settings that attenuated seasonal temperature variations. It was observed that under periods of high vapour pressure deficit, net ecosystem exchange was reduced, which was mainly caused by a decrease in gross primary production. However, no persistent effects of dry conditions on the CO2 exchange dynamics were observed, indicating that under present conditions and within the range of observed meteorological conditions the And{\o}ya blanket bog retained its C uptake function. Continued monitoring of these ecosystem types is essential in order to detect possible effects of a changing climate.},

  abstract = {Permanent grasslands constitute the most widespread land use type for agriculturally managed peatlands in Europe. They are typically significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere as a result of drainage-induced peat decomposition, but quantitative data are still scarce. This study presents an in-depth analysis of CO2 flux variability at the site (n = 3) and plot scale (n = 9) for different Danish permanent grasslands on peat. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and ecosystem respiration were monitored over one year with closed dynamic chambers. The first part of the data analysis consisted of a detailed evaluation of the flux dataset to gain insight into the potential effects of fast fluctuations in the wind and light intensity on the plot scale CO2 flux. In the second part of the analysis, gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were modeled on the field and plot scale with candidate sets of simple light and temperature response models commonly applied in ecological studies. The detailed flux dataset analysis revealed that upward concave flux curves, which are not explainable by diffusion theory, can either be the result of a fan-induced increase in headspace turbulence, or of a photosynthesis overshoot into shaded or darkened chamber measurement periods. Instead of discarding such measurements from the dataset, this study proposes the use of linear flux calculation as a way to obtain less biased flux rate estimates. For the carbon balance modeling, it could be shown that annual NEE estimates for a site differ (0.2{\textendash}0.3 kg CO2 m-2) between different models available for gap-filling CO2 flux time series even when the models were equally suitable according to statistical evaluation. Overall, all plots showed significant carbon losses over the course of a year (1.5{\textendash}5.6 kg CO2 m-2, including harvested aboveground biomass); however, it was not possible to relate spatial differences in the CO2 flux dynamics between and within the study sites to certain peat properties or management types due to high uncertainties in the annual estimates.},

  abstract = {The carbon (C) balance of boreal peatlands is mainly the sum of three different C fluxes: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Intra- and inter-annual dynamics of these fluxes are differentially controlled by similar factors, such as temperature and water-table. Different climatic conditions within and between years might thus result in varying absolute and relative contributions of each flux to net ecosystem productivity (NEP). In this study CO2 fluxes were measured at a boreal peatland in eastern Finland during a dry year (2006) and a wet year (2007) and combined with DOC and CH4 fluxes from the same site. CO2 uptake in the wet year was 65\% higher than in the dry year, caused by higher water table (WT) and subsequently reduced rates of soil respiration. Two to three-fold increases in DOC and CH4 fluxes in the wet year did not completely offset the higher CO2 uptake in that year, resulting in NEP of - 83.7 \ensuremath{\pm} 14 g C m- 2 in the dry and - 134.5 \ensuremath{\pm} 21 g C m- 2 in the wet year. Thus, in our study, WT was identified as the most important factor responsible for variations in the C balance between the observed years.},

We hypothesized that, with a mean water table closer to peat surface and higher pool density, these ecosystems would be great CH4 emitters. In summers 2009 and 2010, methane fluxes were measured in a patterned fen located in the northeastern portion of the La Grande river watershed to determine the contribution of the different microforms (lawns, hollows, hummocks, string, pools) to the annual CH4 budget. Mean seasonal CH4 fluxes from terrestrial microforms ranged between 12.9 and 49.4 mg m-2 day-1 in 2009 and 15.4 and 47.3 mg m-2 day-1 in 2010. Pool fluxes (which do not include ebullition fluxes) ranged between 102.6 and 197.6 mg CH4 m-2 day-1 in 2009 and 76.5 and 188.1 mg CH4 m-2 day-1 in 2010. Highest fluxes were measured in microforms with water table closer to peat surface but no significant relationship was observed between water table depth and CH4 fluxes. Spatially weighted CH4 budget demonstrates that, during the growing season, the studied peatland emitted 66 \ensuremath{\pm} 31 in 2009 and 55 \ensuremath{\pm} 26 mg CH4 m-2 day-1 in 2010, 79 \% of which is accounted by pool fluxes. In a context where climate projections predict greater precipitations in northeastern Canada, these results indicate that this type of peatlands could contribute to modify the methane balance in the atmosphere.},

(2) CO2 fluxes from various peatland sites were measured at control points and points where the roots were severed from the plants. (3) CO2 fluxes in cultivated grassland established on peatland were measured in grassy subsites and in subsites where the growth of grass was prevented by regular tilling.

All the experiments gave similar results, root-derived respiration accounting for 35{\textendash}45\% of total soil respiration in the middle and late summer at sites with an abundant vegetation. The root-derived respiration from the virgin peatland sites correlated well with the tree biomass, and also partly with the understorey vegetation, but in the drained sites the root effect was greater, even in the presence of less understorey vegetation than at virgin subsites.},

  abstract = {We examined the controls on summer CH4 emission from five sites in a peatland complex near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada, representing a minerotrophic gradient from bog to rich fen at wet sites, where the water table positions ranged from -10 to -1 cm. Average CH4 flux, determined by static chambers on collars, ranged from 22 to 239 mg CH4-C m-2 d-1 and was related to peat temperature. There was an inverse relationship between water table position and CH4 flux: higher water tables led to smaller fluxes. The determination of anaerobic CH4 production and aerobic CH4 consumption potentials in laboratory incubations of peat samples was unable to explain much of the variation in CH4 flux. Average net ecosystem exchange of CO2 ranged from 1.4 to 2.5 g CO2-C m-2 d-1 and was strongly correlated with CH4 flux, CH4 emission averaged 4\% of CO2 uptake. End-of-season sedge biomass was also strongly related to CH4 flux, indicating the important role that vascular plants play in regulating CH4 flux. Determination of isotopic signatures in peat pore water CH4 revealed average \ensuremath{\delta}13C values of between -50 and -73{\textperthousand} and \ensuremath{\delta}D of between -368 and -388{\textperthousand}. Sites with large CH4 emission rates also had high CO2 exchange rates and enriched \ensuremath{\delta}13C CH4 signatures, suggesting the importance of the acetate fermentation pathway of methanogenesis. Comparison of \ensuremath{\delta}D and \ensuremath{\delta}13C signatures in pore water CH4 revealed a slope shallow enough to suggest that oxidation is not an important overall control on CH4 emissions at these sites, though it appeared to be important at one site. Analysis of 14C in pore water CH4 showed that most of the CH4 was of recent origin with percent of modern carbon values of between 112 and 128\%. The study has shown the importance of vascular plant activities in controlling CH4 emissions from these wetland sites through influences on the availability of fresh plant material for methanogenesis, rhizospheric oxidation, and plant transport of CH4.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem respiration (ER) is an important but poorly understood part of the carbon (C) budget of peatlands and is controlled primarily by the thermal and hydrologic regimes. To establish the relative importance of these two controls for a large ombrotrophic bog near Ottawa, Canada, we analyzed ER from measurements of nighttime net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) determined by eddy covariance technique. Measurements were made from May to October over five years, 1998 to 2002. Ecosystem respiration ranged from less than 1 \ensuremath{\mu}mol CO2 m-2 s-1 in spring (May) and fall (late October) to 2{\textendash}4 \ensuremath{\mu}mol CO2 m-2 s-1 during mid-summer (July-August). As anticipated, there was a strong relationship between ER and peat temperatures (r 2 = 0.62). Q10 between 5{\textdegree} to 15{\textdegree}C varied from 2.2 to 4.2 depending upon the choice of depth where temperature was measured and location within a hummock or hollow. There was only a weak relationship between ER and water-table depth (r 2 = 0.11). A laboratory incubation of peat cores at different moisture contents showed that CO2 production was reduced by drying in the surface samples, but there was little decrease in production due to drying from below a depth of 30 cm. We postulate that the weak correlation between ER and water table position in this peatland is primarily a function of the bog being relatively dry, with water table varying between 30 and 75 cm below the hummock tops. The dryness gives rise to a complex ER response to water table involving i) compensations between production of CO2 in the upper and lower peat profile as the water table falls and ii) the importance of autotrophic respiration, which is relatively independent of water-table position.},

  abstract = {The focus of this study is the relationship between water table depth (WTD) and water vapor {[}evapotranspiration (ET)] and carbon dioxide {[}CO2; net ecosystem exchange (NEE)] fluxes in a fen in western Canada. We analyzed hydrological and eddy covariance measurements from four snow-free periods (2003{\textendash}2006) with contrasting meteorological conditions to establish the link between daily WTD and ET and gross ecosystem CO2 exchange (GEE) and ecosystem respiration (Reco; NEE=Reco-GEE), respectively: 2003 was warm and dry, 2004 was cool and wet, and 2005 and 2006 were both wet. In 2003, the water table (WT) was below the ground surface. In 2004, the WT rose above the ground surface, and in 2005 and 2006, the WT stayed well above the ground surface. There were no significant differences in total ET (\ensuremath{\sim}316 mm period-1), but total NEE was significantly different (2003: 8 g C m-2 period-1; 2004: -139 g C m-2 period-1; 2005: -163 g C m-2 period-1; 2006: -195 g C m-2 period-1), mostly due to differences in total GEE (2003: 327 g C m-2 period-1; 2004: 513 g C m-2 period-1; 2005: 411 g C m-2 period-1; 2006: 556 g C m-2 period-1). Variation in ET is mostly explained by radiation (67\%), and the contribution of WTD is only minor (33\%). WTD controls the compensating contributions of different land surface components, resulting in similar total ET regardless of the hydrological conditions. WTD and temperature each contribute about half to the explained variation in GEE up to a threshold ponding depth, below which temperature alone is the key explanatory variable. WTD is only of minor importance for the variation in Reco, which is mainly controlled by temperature. Our study implies that future peatland modeling efforts explicitly consider topographic and hydrogeological influences on WTD.},

The EC data were complemented by chamber measurements, which enabled the partition of the daytime NEE into respiration and photosynthesis. A special emphasis was put on the hydrometeorological responses of CO2 exchange during a drought period in July 2005. A mean CO2 efflux of 0.009 mgCO2 m-2 s-1 was observed during mid-winter (January{\textendash}February), while the night-time respiration during the two Julys averaged 0.09 mgCO2 m-2 s-1. During both years the mean mid-day uptake in late July was about -0.16 mgCO2 m-2 s-1. An annual CO2 balance of -188 gCO2 m-2 was observed in 2005. A slightly higher net sink of -219 gCO2 m-2 was estimated for 2004. The drought period experienced in July 2005 caused a clear depression in the daily NEE values. From the combined analysis of EC and chamber measurements it was concluded that this was mainly due to increased respiration, but evidence was also found of suppressed photosynthesis due to a high VPD.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.02.017},
  abstract = {Northern peatlands represent about 30\% of the global soil C pools. The C pool in peat is a result of a relatively small imbalance between production and decay. High water levels and the consequent anoxia are considered the major causes for the imbalance. As such, the C sink of a peatland is labile, and sensitive to disturbances in environmental conditions.

Changes in peatland ecosystem functions may be mediated through land-use change, and/or climatic warming. In both cases, lowering of the water level may be the key factor. Logically, lowered water levels with the consequent increase in oxygen availability in the surface soil may be assumed to result in accelerated rates of organic matter decomposition. Yet, earlier research has given highly contrasting results concerning the effects of lowered water levels on the rates of decomposition and the C sink/source behaviour of peatlands. The mechanisms controlling this variation remain unresolved.

This paper summarizes the changes observed in the biotic and abiotic controls of decomposition following natural or artificial lowering of peatland water levels and show that they are complex and their interactions have not been previously explored. Long-term changes in the C cycle may differ from short-term changes. Short-term changes represent a disturbance in the ecosystem adapted to the pre-water-level-lowering conditions, while long-term changes result from several adaptive mechanisms of the ecosystem to the new hydrological regime. While in a short term, the disturbed system will always lose C, the long-term changes inherently vary among peatland types, climates, and extents of change in the water level. The paper closes by identifying the gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed when proceeding towards a causal and unifying explanation for the C sink/source behaviour of peatlands following persistent lowering of the water level.},
