  abstract = {Boreal and subarctic peatlands comprise a carbon pool of 455 Pg that has accumulated during the postglacial period at an average net rate of 0.096 Pg/yr (1 Pg = 1015g). Using Clymo's (1984) model, the current rate is estimated at 0.076 Pg/yr. Longterm drainage of these peatlands is estimated to be causing the oxidation to CO2 of a little more than 0.0085 Pg/yr, with conbustion of fuel peat adding {\textdegree}0.026 Pg/yr. Emissions of CH4 are estimated to release {\textdegree} 0.046 Pg of carbon annually. Uncertainties beset estimates of both stocks and fluxes, particularly with regard to Soviet peatlands. The influence of water table alterations upon fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 is in great need of investigation over a wide range of peatland environments, especially in regions where permafrost melting, thermokarst erosion, and the development of thaw lakes are likely results of climatic warming. The role of fire in the carbon cycle of peatlands also deserves increased attention. Finally, satellite{\textemdash}monitoring of the abundance of open water in the peatlands of the West Siberian Plain and the Hudson/James Bay Lowland is suggested as a likely method of detecting early effects of climatic warming upon boreal and subarctic peatlands.},

Cet article est centr{\'e} sur la contribution des {\'e}cosyst{\`e}mes naturels (for{\^e}ts, prairies) ou cultiv{\'e}s au stockage de carbone, dans la biomasse et dans les sols. Les stocks actuels sont importants (650 Gt pour la v{\'e}g{\'e}tation, 1500 {\`a} 2000 Gt pour les sols contre 750 Gt pour le CO2 atmosph{\'e}rique) ; les flux le sont {\'e}galement, avec des {\'e}missions de CO2 dans le pass{\'e} (d{\'e}forestation, mise en culture) et actuellement un stockage de carbone (\&gt;2 GtC/an).

Une action anthropique par le reboisement, le changement d'utilisation des terres et de bonnes pratiques culturales peuvent augmenter la s{\'e}questration de carbone dans la biomasse et dans les sols pour des dur{\'e}es de plusieurs d{\'e}cennies, ce qui peut constituer un apport non n{\'e}gligeable {\`a} la lutte contre l'effet de serre dans le cadre du protocole de Kyoto et peut avoir, en plus, des effets b{\'e}n{\'e}fiques pour l'environnement.

This article focuses on the contribution of natural ecosystems (forests, grasslands) and agrosystems to carbon sequestration either in biomass or in soil. Carbon stocks are important (650 Gt in biomass, 1500 to 2000 Gt in soils as compared with 750 for atmospheric CO2), and also fluxes that led to CO2 emissions in the past (due to deforestation or cultivation) and which now turn to carbon sequestration (2 GtC/year). This article shows great spatial variations in stocks and fluxes and great measurement difficulties, especially for stock variations. Anthropic actions such as reforestation (mainly in the North), changes in land use or in crop management, can increase carbon sequestration in biomass or soil, with a residence time of several decades, which is not insignificant with respect to the Kyoto protocol and which also has other environmental benefits.

  abstract = {Measurements on air trapped in old polar ice have revealed that the pre-industrial atmosphere contained 280 ppm of CO2 and that \ensuremath{\delta}13C of atmospheric CO2 decreased by about 1.1 \%, until 1980. These measurements show that considerable amounts of non-fossil CO2 must have already been emitted into the atmosphere in the 19th century. Quantitative estimates of the emission rates were performed by deconvolving the CO2 and \ensuremath{\delta}13C records, using models of the global carbon cycle (box-diffusion and outcrop-diffusion ocean, four-box biosphere). Depending on the structure of the ocean submodel, deconvolution of the CO2 record yields a cumulative non-fossil production of about 90 to 150 Gt C until 1980, of which more than 50\% were released prior to 1900. According to the model results, the net non-fossil production rate was roughly constant in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century. In the past 30 years, smaller values are obtained (0-0.9 Gt C yr-1) which are at the lower limit or below current ecological estimates for deforestation and land use (1.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.8 Gt C yr-1). The difference might possibly be due to other sinks, e.g., stimulation of plant productivity by the enhanced CO2 concentration. Calculated 13C and 14C time histories agree well with the observed changes. While the change of the atmospheric CO2 concentration reflects more the cumulative carbon release, the isotope concentrations are more sensitive to short-term changes of the emission rate. The reason is that the oceanic uptake capacity is smaller for excess CO2 by the buffer factor of {\texttildelow} 10 than for an isotopic perturbation.},

Tropical forests and savannahs account for 60\%. GPP over 40\% of the vegetated land is associated with precipitation. State-of-the-art process-oriented biosphere models used for climate predictions exhibit a large between-model variation of GPP's latitudinal patterns and show higher spatial correlations between GPP and precipitation, suggesting the existence of missing processes or feedback mechanisms which attenuate the vegetation response to climate.

  abstract = {Soil respiration, RS, the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO2) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux. However, the dynamics of RS are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained. Ecosystem warming experiments, modelling analyses and fundamental biokinetics all suggest that RS should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of RS, inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure RS on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global RS values in the extant four-decade record of RS chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide RS observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the RS record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO2 measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961{\textendash}1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in RS. We estimate that the global RS in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 \ensuremath{\pm} 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr-1 between 1989 and 2008, implying a global RS response to air temperature (Q10) of 1.5. An increasing global RS value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

  abstract = {Purpose CH4 emissions from peatlands are space and time dependent. The variety of efflux routes contributes to these variabilities. CH4 bubbling remains difficult to investigate since it occurs on a timescale of seconds. The aims of this study were to use for the first time the recently built infrared high-resolution spectrometer, SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Troposph{\'e}rique to (1) measure in situ CH 4 fluxes in natural and artificial peatland plot and (2) observe online bubbling events with quantification of CH 4 emission fluxes corresponding to this very sudden degassing event. Material and methods The closed dynamic chamber method was used and the gas concentration was measured every 1.5 s. Emission fluxes were calculated by the accumulation rate of CH 4 against time. Measurements were undertaken during daytime in March 2009 and during day- and nighttime in May 2009, in Sphagnum and Betula plots and in a wet artificially bared peat area with Eriophorum vaginatum . Results and discussion The results show that the CH 4 emissions estimated with the SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Troposph{\'e}rique (SPIRIT) are consistent with those already published. The high emissions, both through diffusion and bubbling in the Eriophorum plot, were on the same order as the emissions estimated in natural shallow pools. During daytime, CH 4 bubbling was higher in May (54.7\% of the total emission) than in March (40.7\%) probably because of increased CH 4 production and accumulation in peat. In May, bubbling was higher at nighttime (65.5\%) than in daytime (54.7\%). This has an important implication for carbon budget assessment in peatlands. Conclusions The recently built infrared spectrometer, SPIRIT, was able to reliably measure CH 4 fluxes and quantify CH 4 flux during the degassing of bubbles. The emissions obtained are in agreement with previously published data using other measurement techniques. The results of this preliminary work highlight (1) the importance of shallow pools in peatland CH 4 emissions and (2) the sensitivity of such fluxes to atmospheric pressure, a relation that has not been fully investigated or taken into account in assessing peatland carbon balance.},

The aim of SPIRIT field studies is to get a better understanding of land and water bodies to atmosphere exchange mechanisms of greenhouse gases (GHG). The analytical procedures to derive concentrations and fluxes are described, as well as the performances of the instrument under field conditions. The ability of SPIRIT to assess space and time dependence emissions of two GHG--nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)--for different types of ecosystems is demonstrated through in situ measurements on peatland, on fertilized soil, and on water body systems.

  abstract = {Twenty chambers for measurement of soil CO2 efflux were compared against known CO2 fluxes ranging from 0.32 to 10.01 \ensuremath{\mu}mol CO2 m-2 s-1 and generated by a specially developed calibration tank. Chambers were tested on fine and coarse homogeneous quartz sand with particle sizes of 0.05{\textendash}0.2 and 0.6 mm, respectively. The effect of soil moisture on chamber measurements was tested by wetting the fine quartz sand to about 25\% volumetric water content. Non-steady-state through-flow chambers either underestimated or overestimated fluxes from -21 to +33\% depending on the type of chamber and the method of mixing air within the chamber's headspace. However, when results of all systems tested were averaged, fluxes were within 4\% of references. Non-steady-state non-through-flow chambers underestimated or overestimated fluxes from {\textendash}35 to +6\%. On average, the underestimation was about 13{\textendash}14\% on fine sand and 4\% on coarse sand. When the length of the measurement period was increased, the underestimation increased due to the rising concentration within the chamber headspace, which reduced the diffusion gradient within the soil. Steady-state through-flow chambers worked almost equally well in all sand types used in this study. They overestimated the fluxes on average by 2{\textendash}4\%. Overall, the reliability of the chambers was not related to the measurement principle per se. Even the same chambers, with different collar designs, showed highly variable results. The mixing of air within the chamber can be a major source of error. Excessive turbulence inside the chamber can cause mass flow of CO2 from the soil into the chamber. The chamber headspace concentration also affects the flux by altering the concentration gradient between the soil and the chamber.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter introduces a variety of methods for measurement of soil respiration. Accurate measurements of soil \{CO2\} efflux are extraordinarily challenging due to the properties of \{CO2\} transport in a porous medium of soil. Any measurement methods that disturb the soil \{CO2\} concentration and/or distort the gradient would result in serious errors. The most commonly used are chamber methods, which include the closed dynamic-chamber method, the open dynamic-chamber method, and the closed static-chamber method. Soil respiration is determined using alkali traps, by absorbing \{CO2\} released from the soil into a sealed headspace chamber for a specific period, using NaOH or \{KOH\} solutions. The soda-lime technique has been used for more than 40 years to measure \{CO2\} effluxes from soil under field conditions. Soil respiration can also be estimated from air samples from different depths of soil using the gas-well method. This chapter describes the basic principles behind those methods, discusses chamber designs and deployment, and assesses the accuracy and potential issues of those methods. It also briefly describes a few indirect methods for estimation of soil respiration.},

  abstract = {Soil surface CO2 flux was measured in hollow and hummock microhabitats in a peatland in north central Minnesota from June to October in 1991. We used a closed infrared gas exchange system to measure soil CO2 flux. The rates of CO2 evolution from hummocks (9.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 3.5 g m-2 d-1, {[}mean \ensuremath{\pm} SE]) were consistently higher than those from hollows (5.4 \ensuremath{\pm} 2.9 g m-2 d-1) (the hummock values included the contribution of moss dark respiration, which may account for 10{\textendash}20\% of the total measured flux). The soil CO2 flux was strongly temperature-dependent (Q10 \ensuremath{\approx} 3.7) and appeared to be linearly related to changes in water table depth. An empirical multiplicative model, using peat temperature and water table depth as independent variables, explained about 81\% of the variance in the CO2 flux data. Using the empirical model with measurements of peat temperature and estimates of hollow/hummock microtopographic distribution (relative to water table elevation), daily rates of ``site-averaged'' CO2 evolution were calculated. For the six-month period (May{\textendash}October), the total soil CO2 released from this ecosystem was estimated to be about 1340 g CO2 m-2.},

  abstract = {Northern peatland water table position is tightly coupled to carbon (C) cycling dynamics and is predicted to change from shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns associated with global climate change. However, it is uncertain how long-term water table alterations will alter C dynamics in northern peatlands because most studies have focused on short-term water table manipulations. The goal of our study was to quantify the effect of long-term water table changes ({\textasciitilde}80 years) on gaseous C fluxes in a peatland in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Chamber methods were utilized to measure ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and methane (CH4) fluxes in a peatland experiencing levee induced long-term water table drawdown and impoundment in relation to an unaltered site. Inundation raised water table levels by approximately {\textasciitilde}10 cm and resulted in a decrease in ER and GPP, but an increase of CH4 emissions. Conversely, the drained sites, with water table levels {\textasciitilde}15 cm lower, resulted in a significant increase in ER and GPP, but a decrease in CH4 emissions. However, NEE was not significantly different between the water table treatments. In summary, our data indicates that long-term water table drawdown and inundation was still altering peatland gaseous C fluxes, even after 80 years. In addition, many of the patterns we found were of similar magnitude to those measured in short-term studies, which indicates that short-term studies might be useful for predicting the direction and magnitude of future C changes in peatlands.},

The contribution of roots, a relatively fast component of soil cycling, was studied in three experiments. (1) Willows were grown in a greenhouse and CO2 fluxes from the substrate soil (milled peat) and from control peat were measured. (2) CO2 fluxes from various peatland sites were measured at control points and points where the roots were severed from the plants. (3) CO2 fluxes in cultivated grassland established on peatland were measured in grassy subsites and in subsites where the growth of grass was prevented by regular tilling. The root-derived respiration followed the typical annual phenology of the vegetation, being at its maximum in the middle and late summer. All the experiments gave similar results, root-derived respiration accounting for 35{\textendash}45\% of total soil respiration in the middle and late summer at sites with an abundant vegetation. The root-derived respiration from the virgin peatland sites correlated well with the tree biomass, and also partly with the understorey vegetation, but in the drained sites the root effect was greater, even in the presence of less understorey vegetation than at virgin subsites.},
